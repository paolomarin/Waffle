[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/EthWorks/Waffle.svg?token=xjj4U84eSFwEsYLTc5Qe&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/EthWorks/Waffle)

![Ethereum Waffle](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EthWorks/Waffle/master/docs/images/logo.png)

Library for writing and testing smart contracts.

Sweeter and simpler than [truffle](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle).

Works with [ethers-js](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/). Tastes best with ES6.

## Philosophy
* __Simpler__: minimalistic, a couple of helpers, matchers and tasks rather than a framework, few dependencies.
* __Sweeter__: Nice syntax, fast, easy to extend.

## Versions and ethers compatibility
* Use version 0.2.3+ with ethers 3.*
* Use version 1.0.0+ with ethers 4.*

## Install:
To start using with npm, type:
```sh
npm i ethereum-waffle
```

or with Yarn:
```sh
yarn add ethereum-waffle
```

## Step by step guide

### Example contract
Below is example contract written in Solidity. Place it in `contracts` directory of your project:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

import "../BasicToken.sol";

contract BasicTokenMock is BasicToken {

  constructor(address initialAccount, uint256 initialBalance) public {
    balances[initialAccount] = initialBalance;
    totalSupply_ = initialBalance;
  }

}
```

### Example test
Belows is example test written for the contract above written with Waffle. Place it in `test` directory of your project:

```js
import chai from 'chai';
import {createMockProvider, deployContract, getWallets, solidity} from 'ethereum-waffle';
import BasicTokenMock from './build/BasicTokenMock';

chai.use(solidity);

const {expect} = chai;

describe('Example', () => {
  let provider;
  let token;
  let wallet;
  let walletTo;

  beforeEach(async () => {
    provider = createMockProvider();
    [wallet, walletTo] = await getWallets(provider);
    token = await deployContract(wallet, BasicTokenMock, [wallet.address, 1000]);
  });

  it('Assigns initial balance', async () => {
    expect(await token.balanceOf(wallet.address)).to.eq(1000);
  });

  it('Transfer adds amount to destination account', async () => {
    await token.transfer(walletTo.address, 7);
    expect(await token.balanceOf(wallet.address)).to.eq(993);
    expect(await token.balanceOf(walletTo.address)).to.eq(7);
  });

  it('Transfer emits event', async () => {
    await expect(token.transfer(walletTo.address, 7))
      .to.emit(token, 'Transfer')
      .withArgs(wallet.address, walletTo.address, 7);
  });

  it('Can not transfer from empty account', async () => {
    const tokenFromOtherWallet = contractWithWallet(token, walletTo);
    await expect(tokenFromOtherWallet.transfer(wallet.address, 1))
      .to.be.revertedWith('Not enough balance on sender account');
  });
});
```

### Compile
To compile contracts simply type:
```sh
npx waffle
```

To compile using custom configuration file:
```sh
npx waffle config.json
```

Example configuration file looks like this:
```json
{
  "sourcesPath": "./custom_contracts",
  "targetPath": "./custom_build",
  "npmPath": "./custom_node_modules"
}
```

### Run tests
To run test type in the console:
```sh
mocha
```

### Adding a task
For convince, you can add a task to your `package.json`. In the sections `scripts`, add following line:
```json
  "test": "waffle && test"
```

Now you can build and test your contracts with one command:
```sh
npm test
```

## Features walkthrough

### Import contracts from npms
Import solidity files from solidity files form npm modules that you added to your project, e.g:
```
import "openzeppelin-solidity/contracts/math/SafeMath.sol";
```

### Create a mock provider
Create a mock provider (no need to run any tests!) and test your contracts against it, e.g.:
```js
provider = createMockProvider();
```

### Get example wallets
Get wallets you can use to sign transactions:
```js
[wallet, walletTo] = await getWallets(provider);
```

### Deploy contract
Deploy a contract:
```js
token = await deployContract(wallet, BasicTokenMock, [wallet.address, 1000]);
```

### Chai matchers
A set of sweet chai matchers, makes your test easy to write and read. Below couple of examples.

* Testing big numbers:
```js
expect(await token.balanceOf(wallet.address)).to.eq(993);
```
Available matchers for BigNumbers are: `equal`, `eq`, `above`, `below`, `least`, `most`.

* Testing what events where emitted with what arguments:
```js
await expect(token.transfer(walletTo.address, 7))
  .to.emit(token, 'Transfer')
  .withArgs(wallet.address, walletTo.address, 7);
```

* Testing if transaction was reverted:
```js
await expect(token.transfer(walletTo.address, 1007)).to.be.reverted;
```

* Testing if transaction was reverted with certain message:
```js
await expect(token.transfer(walletTo.address, 1007)).to.be.revertedWith('Insufficient funds');
```


* Testing if string is a proper address:
```js
expect('0x28FAA621c3348823D6c6548981a19716bcDc740e').to.be.properAddress;
```

* Testing if string is a proper secret:
```js
expect('0x706618637b8ca922f6290ce1ecd4c31247e9ab75cf0530a0ac95c0332173d7c5').to.be.properPrivateKey;
```

* Testing if string is a proper hex value of given length:
```js
expect('0x70').to.be.properHex(2);
```

## Fast complication
By default, Waffle uses solcjs. Solcjs is solidity complier cross-complied to javascript. It is slow, but easy to install.
As an alternative, you can use the original Solidity compiler, which is faster, but requires more complex installation procedure, which is different for each operating system.

You can find installation instructions [here](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing-solidity.html#binary-packages).

Once installed you can use the following command for faster complication:
```sh
npx waffle --fast-compile
```

That should speed up complication time by a factor of x10.

## Roadmap

* New matcher: changeBalance (see [#9](https://github.com/EthWorks/Waffle/issues/9))
* Faster testing with parallelization
* Faster compilation with incremental compilation
* Documentation
* Debugging
